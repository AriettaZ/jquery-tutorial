<h1>jQuery Selectors</h1>
  - JQuery selectors allow you to select one or more HTML elements based on the tag names, ids, classes, attributes, etc. After selecting an element, you can manipulate it.
  - All selectors start with the dollar sign and parentheses: $().

<h2>Basic Selectors</h2>
  - The element Selector
    - Selects all elements based on the elements tag name.
    - Syntax: write the element's tag name.
    ```
    $("element")
    ```
    - Example: $("p") selects all \<p\> elements in the document

  - The #id Selector
    - An id is unique within a page so the id selector is used to find a single element with the specific id.
    - Syntax: write a hash character (#) followed by the value of the id attribute of the element.
    ```
    $("#id")
    ```
    - Example: $("p#test-id") selects the \<p\> element that has an id "test-id".

  - The .class Selector
    - Selects all elements with a specific class.
    - Syntax: write a period character (.) followed by the name of the class.
    ```
    $(".class")
    ```
    - Example: $("p.test-class) selects all \<p\> elements that have a class "test-class".

<h2>Attribute Selectors</h2>
  - Attribute selectors help select elements based on attribute name and value.
  - The Has Attribute Selector [attribute]
    - Selects all elements that have specific attribute.
    - Syntax: write the attribute name inside of the square brackets([ ]).
    ```
    $("[attribute]")
    ```
    - Example: $("[href]") selects all elements that have a href attribute.

  - The Attribute Equals Selector [attribute=value]
    - Selects all elements that have specific attribute with specific value.
    - Syntax: write the attribute name and its value inside of the square brackets([ ]) connecting by the equal sign(=).
    ```
    $("[attribute=value]")
    ```
    - Example: $("[type='text']") selects elements that have a type attribute with value "text".

  - The Attribute Starts With Selector [attribute^=value]
    - Selects elements that have the specific attribute with a value starting with the specific value.
    - Syntax: write the attribute and its value inside of the square brackets([ ]) connecting by the caret(^) and the equal sign(=).
    ```
    $("[attribute^=value]")
    ```
    - Example: $("[title^='Hi']") selects all elements that have a title attribute whose value is starting with "Hi".

  - :nth-last-child(n)
    - Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent, counting from the last element(index = 1) to the first.
    - Syntax:
    ```
    $(":nth-last-child(index/even/odd/equation)")
    ```
    - Example: $("p:nth-last-child(1)") selects all \<p\> that are the last child of their parent
